# OpenXmlBrowser
Generates a .html file (and displays it in the default browser) with the contents of any Open XML file. .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.

# Overview

I created this as a tool to help me work I'm doing with Excel spreadsheets. In the middle of working on it, I realized it can also be used to look at any Open XML format file.

# Generated HTML and CSS

The HTML and CSS came from some pages in the site, https://renenyffenegger.ch/ that I found while Googling. He turned out to be a prolific github contributor. https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger
I've e-mailed him asking for his permission (assuming since the page is publicly available and that he's a heavy github contributor, that it won't be a problem. If it is, I'll replace the HTML and CSS.)

# Example

Command: OpenXmlBrowser D:\Temp\PRs.xlsx
